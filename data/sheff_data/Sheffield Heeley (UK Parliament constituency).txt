Sheffield Heeley is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2015 by Louise Haigh, a member of the Labour Party. It is located in the city of Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

History
This seat was created in 1950, largely replacing the former Sheffield Ecclesall constituency, its boundaries being significantly altered in 1955 with the abolition of Sheffield Neepsend. At its first five elections, up to but excluding 1966, the seat was won by a Conservative, Peter Roberts; it changed hands three times between 1966 and 1974.
Against the national swing, the 1979 election saw Sheffield Heeley move from being a marginal Labour seat to having a solid Labour majority. Of the subsequent elections, only the 1983 and 2010 results have been fairly marginal; the others have suggested a safe Labour seat. At the 2010 election the Liberal Democrat had more than a quarter of the vote, whereas the Conservatives, on 17.3%, garnered 3% more votes than in 2005.
