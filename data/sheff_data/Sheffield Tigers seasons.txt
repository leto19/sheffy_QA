Season Overview
The 2010 season saw the Tigers return to a successful season after a couple of seasons of mediocracy. The Tigers finished the 2010 Premier League campaign in 4th place and thus qualifying for the Premier League Play-Offs. The Tigers started the season poorly in the Premier Trophy by finishing 3rd in the midland qualifying group, with the solitary away win at Redcar. However, a home loss against Birmingham was enough to condemn the Tigers to Premier Trophy Elimination. The Tigers league campaign started off slowly but fired into life on the May Bank Holiday Weekend, with 3 wins (1 Home, 2 Away) in 3 days. The win at the Premier League Pairs by Ricky Ashworth & Josh Auty was a boost in the Tigers confidence, as well as the first team silverware since 2002.
The Tigers may have stalled at home against Edinburgh Monarchs and Newcastle Diamonds (Who finished 1st and 2nd Respectively) but with 5 away wins (3rd most in the league) at Redcar, Workington, Stoke, Scunthorpe and Glasgow, the Tigers finished the season in 4th place, qualifying for the play-offs. The Edinburgh Monarchs elected to play the Tigers in the semi-finals confident of gaining a result after home and away wins against the Tigers during the PL campaign. After taking a 59–31 to Owlerton, Sheffield pulled off one of the shocks and results of the season by overturning the 28 points deficit by winning at Owlerton 61-31 (92-90 Aggregate Score). This result enabled the Tigers to take on the Newcastle in the play-off final for a chance to have a crack at the Ipswich Witches in a promotion/relegation battle. However, although Sheffield overcame Newcastle 53–43 at Owlerton (And Ricky Ashworth once again broke the Owlerton Track Record from 59.2 to 59.1), the Diamonds romped to victory at Brough Park 58-36 (101-89 Agg) and effectively ended the Tigers season.
