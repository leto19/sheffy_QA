Elections to Sheffield City Council were held on 5 May 1994. One third of the council was up for election. Since the previous election, three by-elections had taken place, resulting in two Lib Dem gains from Labour in Brightside and Walkley and a successful hold of a Dore seat by the Conservatives.
