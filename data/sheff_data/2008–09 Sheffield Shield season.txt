The 2008–09 Sheffield Shield season was the 107th season of official first-class domestic cricket in Australia. After nine seasons of being named the Pura Cup, it was announced that the Australian interstate trophy would return to its previous name of the Sheffield Shield as part of a new sponsorship agreement with Weet-Bix. The season began on 10 October 2008 when the Queensland took on Tasmania at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. The Victorian Bushrangers claimed the title following a draw with Queensland in the final at the Junction Oval.
