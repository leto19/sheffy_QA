Sheffield City Council elections took place on Thursday 6 May 2010. There were 28 seats up for election in 2010, one of the three councillors from each ward. Since the previous election, Liberal Democrat councillor Frank Taylor had defected to an Independent leaving the Liberal Democrats with 44 councillors. Turnout was up dramatically with it being held alongside the general election, to 62.6%. The higher turnout helped mainly Labour against their electoral rivals, who managed to return the council to no overall control with three gains. This was bolstered by the newly elected Liberal Democrat in Walkley defecting to Labour immediately after being elected.

Election result
The Labour Party gained two seats from their position following the 2006 election, but also regained a seat lost to the Liberal Democrats through a double vacancy election in Mosborough.
This result has the following consequences for the total number of seats on the Council after the elections:
