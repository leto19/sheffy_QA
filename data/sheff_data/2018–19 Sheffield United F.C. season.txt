The 2018–19 season was Sheffield United's 130th season in their history and second consecutive in the Championship. Along with the Championship, the club also competed in the FA Cup and EFL Cup. The season covers the period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. They were promoted to the Premier League during this season, after a long battle with Leeds United. A 2–0 home victory vs Ipswich Town sealed their first promotion to the top flight since 2005-06.
Their season started poorly after they fell to bottom of the league after 2 defeats to Swansea City and Middlesbrough respectively. They bounced back with 4 wins in a row between games 3 and 6. They had mixed form until Christmas, but after the halfway point they suffered just 2 defeats in 23 games. 2 draws to Birmingham City and Millwall late on in the season made it look a hard task for Sheffield United to finish 2nd. However, Leeds United somewhat bottled the season in the late stages and Sheffield United were presented with a chance to seal promotion against Ipswich Town on Matchday 45. They won the game 2–0 and were all but promoted to the Premier League. Their victory was arithmetically confirmed after Leeds United drew 1–1 at home to Aston Villa.
