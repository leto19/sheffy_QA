During the 1991–92 English football season, Sheffield United F.C. competed in the Football League First Division.

Season summary
In the 1991–92 season, the Blades had a poor start to the season and were bottom of the table at the beginning of November with just 2 wins in their first 15 league games and were destined for relegation but from mid-January, Bassett's team went on an impressive run, losing only 2 of their next 15 league games, picking up 34 points from the possible 45 during that run which saw them rise from being relegation candidates to an impressive 9th-place finish. Their highlight of the season was doing the double over their rivals Sheffield Wednesday, who finished 3rd that season.
