He was the son of John Sheffield, 2nd Baron Sheffield and Douglas Howard, and the grandson of Sir Edmund Sheffield. His grandfather, a second cousin of Henry VIII, was raised to the Peerage in 1547 as Baron Sheffield, of Butterwick, and in 1549 was murdered in the streets of Norwich during Kett's Rebellion.
He married, firstly, Ursula Tyrwhitt, by whom he had at least one daughter, Mary Sheffield and, secondly, Mariana Irwin.
He was succeeded by his grandson, likely via his second wife Mariana Irwin, Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Earl of Mulgrave.
