The Sheffield Baronetcy, of Normanby in the County of Lincoln, is a title in the Baronetage of Great Britain. It was created on 1 March 1755 for Charles Herbert Sheffield,  the illegitimate son of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.
On the death of his half brother, the 2nd Duke, in 1735, he inherited the family estates including Buckingham House which was sold to George III in 1762 and Normanby Hall which latter remained the family residence until 1963. Thereafter the family's home was Sutton Park, York.

The fourth Baronet served as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1817 and the fifth Baronet in 1872. The sixth Baronet sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Brigg.
Samantha Cameron is the daughter of the eighth Baronet and Cara Delevingne, the great-great-granddaughter of the sixth Baronet.
