Through his mother, he was a second cousin once removed of the reigning English monarch, King Henry VIII.

Life
Following his father's death in 1531, his wardship was granted to George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, the brother of Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn. However, both Rochford and Boleyn were executed in 1536, and his wardship was transferred to John de Vere, the fifteenth Earl of Oxford.
Sheffield married Anne de Vere, daughter of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, before 31 January 1538, and by her had a son and three daughters. In 1547 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Sheffield of Butterwick. Two years later, during Kett's Rebellion in Norwich, Lord Sheffield was killed in a street near the Cathedral Close when he fell from his horse, removed his helmet assuming the customary capture and eventual ransom, yet was fatally struck by a butcher.He was buried at St Martin at Palace, Norwich.
