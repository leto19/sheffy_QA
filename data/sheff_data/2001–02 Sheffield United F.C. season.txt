Season summary
During the 2001–02 campaign, the Blades hoped to build on last season's top-half finish, but inconsistent results and too many draws cost them the opportunity to challenge for promotion via the play-offs. They finished in 13th place – a disappointing mid-table finish in Neil Warnock's second full season in charge.
