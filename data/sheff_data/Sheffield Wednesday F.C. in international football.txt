1995–96 Intertoto Cup
Wednesday were invited to compete in the inaugural Intertoto Cup in 1995, and placed in Group 1. The Owls' first match against FC Basel took place while most of the players were still on holiday, so guest players had to pull on the blue and white shirt - one was John Pearson, who had last appeared for the club 10 years earlier. Wednesday finished second in the five team group, which was not enough to take them into the next round of the competition.Group 1

Both home matches were played at Rotherham United's Millmoor as Hillsborough was unavailable.
