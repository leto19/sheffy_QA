The 2003 Sheffield Council election took place on 1 May 2003 to elect members of Sheffield City Council. One third of the council was up for election, and Labour took control of the council from no overall control, with six gains from the Liberal Democrats.The election saw a trial of electronic voting in half of the council's wards. Voters in these wards were able to vote by either text message, touch tone phone, internet, post, or use electronic kiosks as well as the normal polling stations. Overall turnout was 29.5%, a half a percent fall on the previous year, a drop negated somewhat by the higher turnout in the wards trialing electronic voting.
