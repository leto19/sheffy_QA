The elections seen heavy swings against the ruling Labour Party, resulting in four losses and further narrow defends in wards Labour had represented consistently for a considerable amount of time. The seats Labour lost were Heeley, Moor and Sharrow to the Conservative-Liberals and Firth Park became the first ever win for the Ratepayers Association. Weather was blamed for Labour's slump, with one article labelling it as 'the year of Tory weather', recording a low of 25% turnout.
