Elections to Sheffield City Council were held on 4 May 2000. One third of the council was up for election. Previous to this election, two Liberal Democrats – Robert Watson and Trefor Morgan – became Independents. Similarly there were two Labour defections, long-time Labour councillor Dorothy Walton went to the Liberal Democrats and Michael Smith became an Independent.
The election saw the Liberal Democrats extend their majority through a couple of gains from Labour, with both parties recouping seats where aforementioned defections had taken place. Vote wise, the Liberal Democrat vote notably fell back from their previous elections' consistent increases, whereas the Conservatives managed their best vote share since 1992. Overall turnout was 25.8%.
