Sheffield's Municipal elections were held on 10 May 1962. One third of the council was up for election, as well as vacancies in Moor and Park. Previous to this election, there had been two by-elections in June for Hallam and Woodseats, which were safely held by the Conservatives. The election seen a record number of 84 candidates, with the Liberals contesting half of the city's wards and the Communists and the Union Movement over a third. The increased presence of the Liberals helped them to triple their vote on the previous year's, and nearly see to a gain in Hillsborough.  There were, however, no seats exchanged for the second year running. Turnout was 31.8%, down slightly on the previous year.
