The Sheffield Round Walk is a 14 mi (23 km) walk through the south west of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. Starting from Hunters Bar, it travels along the Porter valley to Ringinglow. It then descends through the Limb valley and Ecclesall Woods to Abbeydale Road, before climbing through Ladies Spring Wood to Graves Park. The walk then passes through the Gleadless valley, Meersbrook Park and Chelsea Park before returning to Hunters Bar.

Round Sheffield Run
The annual Round Sheffield Run event follows the route of the Sheffield Round Walk. It is typically held on the last Sunday of June, and it is a fundraiser for the Weston Park Cancer Charity. The timed portions of the event split the route into 11 sections covering a total of 20 km (12 mi), separated by untimed sections that cover the remainder of the Walk's length.
