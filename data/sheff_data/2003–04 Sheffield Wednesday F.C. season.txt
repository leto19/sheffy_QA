During the 2003â€“04 English football season, Sheffield Wednesday competed in the Football League Second Division.

Season summary
After relegation the previous season, Sheffield Wednesday competed in the third tier of English football for the first time in over 20 years. Wednesday made a positive start to the season and were 2nd in the league by mid-September. As results slipped through Autumn they slid down to mid table, although they remained around 6 points from the play off places going into the new year. An upturn in form never materialised and as the season wore on and promotion became less likely, results turned for the worse. Wednesday lost 9 of their last 13 league games finishing 16th, 20 points from a play off position and only avoiding relegation by 3 points.
