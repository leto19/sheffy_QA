During the 2004–05 English football season, Sheffield United competed in the Football League Championship.

Season summary
In 2004–05 season, Warnock once again brought in a host of new faces with the pick being arguably the signings of former Sheffield Wednesday players Bromby, Quinn and Geary. The Blades again flirted around the play-offs places but some inconsistent performances, which included only winning 5 of their last 20 Championship games, saw the club again fall just short of the top six.
