Active in politics as a Republican, Sheffield was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1893 and served one term. From 1895 to 1898, he was a member of New York City's Board of Fire Commissioners, and he was the board's president in 1897 and 1898.

Ambassador
In 1924, he was selected to serve as Ambassador to Mexico, with Hughes playing a leading role in obtaining the appointment from President Coolidge. Sheffield served until 1927 and earned notoriety for expressing racist views of and contempt for individuals in the Mexican government. In 1925, he acted on his own to reprimand Mexico's government for its support of Augusto César Sandino's revolutionary movement in Nicaragua, which complicated the Coolidge administration's efforts to maintain a policy of nonconfrontation with Mexico. Sheffield was replaced by Dwight Morrow, who received favorable publicity for his work to create a friendly relationship with President Plutarco Elías Calles.
