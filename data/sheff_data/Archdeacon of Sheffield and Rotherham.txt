In 1913 the deanery of Wath was split off to form part of the new Archdeaconry of Doncaster.In 1914 the Archdeaconries of Sheffield and Doncaster were split off from the Diocese of York to create the new Diocese of Sheffield. In 1942 the deaneries of Sheffield and Handsworth were abolished and replaced by the deaneries of Attercliffe, Ecclesall, Hallam, Laughton and Tankersley.
