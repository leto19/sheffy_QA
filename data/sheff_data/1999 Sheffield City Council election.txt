Elections to Sheffield City Council were held on 6 May 1999 with one third of the council was up for election.  Previous to this election, there had been a by-election in Park, resulting in a Liberal Democrat gain from Labour, effectively cancelling out the concurrent defection of sitting Stocksbridge councillor Alan Pears from the Lib Dems to Labour.  The election saw the Liberal Democrats gain control of the council - the first time since its formation for it not to be controlled by Labour.  The results themselves were more favourable to Labour than recent elections.  However, they suffered double-digit losses, with the Liberal Democrats sustaining their recent election surges.
