The Heart of the City was a Â£130 million major re-development in Sheffield, England begun in 2004, and completed in 2016 and one of the 12 official quarters of Sheffield City Centre. As its name suggests the Heart of the City is located in the heart of the city centre.
Heart of the City was mainly developed by Sheffield One, an Urban Regeneration Company set up in February 2000 to facilitate the redevelopment. The Heart of the City scheme has created many new public spaces, buildings, and skyscrapers. Subsequent review found that it satisfied many of the goals for a successful city laid out in the "Sheffield First" plan.
