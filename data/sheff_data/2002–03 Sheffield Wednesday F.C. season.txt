During the 2002–03 English football season, Sheffield Wednesday competed in the Football League First Division.

Season summary
After the Owls made a terrible start to the 2002–03 season, manager Terry Yorath resigned in October and Hartlepool manager Chris Turner - a former Owls goalkeeper - was appointed as his replacement. Turner made a big effort to rejuvenate the side and there were some impressive results during the final weeks of the season, but a failure to beat Brighton in the penultimate game of the season condemned them to relegation.
