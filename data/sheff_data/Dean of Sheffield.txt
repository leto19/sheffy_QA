The Dean of Sheffield is the head (primus inter pares – first among equals) and chair of the chapter of canons, the ruling body of Sheffield Cathedral. The dean and chapter are based at the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Sheffield. Before 2000 the post was designated as a provost, which was then the equivalent of a dean at most English cathedrals. The cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Sheffield and seat of the Bishop of Sheffield.
