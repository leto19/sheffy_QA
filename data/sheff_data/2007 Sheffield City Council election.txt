Sheffield City Council elections took place on Thursday 3 May 2007 with one third of council seats up for election; one in each ward. Since the previous election, Liberal Democrat Martin Davis (representing Stocksbridge & Upper Don) defected, sitting as an independent. This set of elections saw the Conservatives lose the only seat they had on the council since 1996, and the party did not have any councillors elected to Sheffield City Council until 2021.
The election seen several gains for the Liberal Democrats, returning the council to no overall control. Overall turnout was 36.0%, up slightly from last year's 34.5%.
