The 2019–20 season was Sheffield United's 131st season in their history and the first season back in the Premier League since the 2006–07 season after gaining promotion for finishing in the second place in the EFL Championship last season. Along with the Premier League, the club also competed in the FA Cup and EFL Cup. The season covered the period from 1 July 2019 to 26 July 2020.
The season was widely considered one of the best in the history of Sheffield United after finishing 9th and defying all the odds. Before the start of the season, the Blades were tipped to be relegated by most critics and pundits in the Premier League community. Manager Chris Wilder's 5-3-2 'overlapping centre-backs' was praised by many after it dragged a group of relatively below standard players to a top half Premier League finish.
