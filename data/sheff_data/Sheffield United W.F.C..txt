Sheffield United Women Football Club is an English women's football club based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The club currently play in the FA Women's Championship.

History
In his role as Sheffield United's Community Officer, Tony Currie founded a female team called Sheffield Hallam United in 1993. When this team folded after five seasons, one of Currie's coaches Andy Keenan began hosting sessions for Year Five girls in Heeley. Despite only five players attending the first training session, they entered a local youth league in 1998–99 as Sheffield United Community Girls.
In 2002, an adult East Midlands Regional Women's Football League club called Sheffield Inter (formerly Inter Owls) were close to folding and Sheffield United Community Girls and Ladies successfully bid to take their place in 2002–03. Under new manager Derek Baxby the club finished 5th in its first season, 3rd in its second season and then finished as runners-up to Derby County in 2004–05. Inspired by 75-goal striker Jodie Michalska, the club secured promotion to the Midland Combination Women's Football League in 2005–06.
