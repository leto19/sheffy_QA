Pinter: A Celebration
Sheffield Theatres' programme  Pinter: A Celebration took place from 11 October to 11 November 2006.  The programme featured selected productions of Harold Pinter's plays, in order of presentation: The Caretaker, No Man's Land, Family Voices, Tea Party, The Room, One for the Road and The Dumb Waiter. These films (mostly his screenplays; some in which Pinter appears as an actor) were shown:  The Go-Between, Accident, The Birthday Party, The French Lieutenant's Woman, Reunion, Mojo, The Servant and The Pumpkin Eater
Pinter: A Celebration also included other related programme events: "Pause for Thought" (Penelope Wilton and Douglas Hodge in conversation with Michael Billington), "Ashes to Ashes – A Cricketing Celebration", a "Pinter Quiz Night", "The New World Order", the BBC Two documentary film Arena: Harold Pinter (introduced by Anthony Wall, producer of Arena), and "The New World Order – A Pause for Peace" (a consideration of "Pinter's pacifist writing" [both poems and prose] supported by the Sheffield Quakers), and a screening of "Pinter's passionate and antagonistic 45-minute Nobel Prize Lecture."
