Season summary
Several good results, including a home draw against Liverpool on the first day of the season and wins over Arsenal and Newcastle United saw Sheffield United keep ahead of the relegation zone for much of the season. However, West Ham United's late run of good form, combined with a broken leg suffered by top scorer Rob Hulse against Chelsea that left the Blades lacking firepower up front, saw Sheffield United sucked into the relegation battle and they were relegated on the final day of the season on goal difference after losing at home to Wigan Athletic; a draw would have been good enough to keep United up. Wigan Athletic's win kept them up at United's expense and in a twist of fate, David Unsworth, who had started the season at Sheffield United and had been let go in January 2007 on a free transfer, scored the goal that sent down former club Sheffield United, whilst simultaneously saving Wigan Athletic from relegation, 3 minutes after arriving on the pitch as substitute.
