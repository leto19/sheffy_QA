Sheffield Neepsend was a short-lived Parliamentary constituency in the City of Sheffield, England. The constituency was created in 1950 and abolished in 1955, presumably due to its low number of electors - never exceeding 50,000.  It was one of the safest Labour Party seats, and this was why its first MP, Harry Morris, agreed to step down in order that Government Minister Frank Soskice could gain a seat in the Commons in the 1950 by-election.
