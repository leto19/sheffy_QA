Elections to Sheffield City Council were held on 10 June 2004. The whole council was up for election with boundary changes having taken place since the last election in 2003, reducing the number of seats by 3. This election was the first all-postal vote election held, dramatically improving overall turnout by 14.4% on the previous election to 43.9%. The Labour Party kept its overall majority and continued to run the council, albeit on a much slimmer majority. Previous to the boundary changes, sitting Hillsborough councillor Peter MacLoughlin defected from the Liberal Democrats to an Independent, choosing not to contest this election.
