During the 1992–93 English football season, Sheffield United competed in the inaugural season of the FA Premier League under manager Dave Bassett.

Season summary
Highlights of the season included a 6–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur and an opening-day 2–1 win over eventual champions Manchester United. The club also reached the FA Cup semi-final, but were beaten by arch-rivals Sheffield Wednesday. In the victory over Man Utd Brian Deane scored the first ever Premier League goal.
At the end of the season, the newly formed League Managers Association presented its "Manager of the Year" award for the first time, specifically designed to recognise "the manager who made best use of the resources available to him". This award went to United manager Dave Bassett.
