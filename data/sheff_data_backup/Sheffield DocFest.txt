==About Sheffield DocFest==

Sheffield DocFest is the UK's leading documentary festival and one of the world's most influential markets for documentary projects. The festival champions and presents the breadth of documentary form – film, television, immersive and art – in the vibrant city of Sheffield each June. DocFest offers makers and audiences a place for inspiration, debate, development, learning and challenge. DocFest's programming represents the festival's core values – creativity, empathy, freedom, inclusivity and internationalism.

Over the years, the festival has been held at over 20 other venues across [[Sheffield]] and the surrounding area, including the [http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/ Showroom Workstation], [[The Light Cinemas|Light Cinema]], [[Sheffield Town Hall]], [[Sheffield City Hall]], and the DocFest Exchange on [[Tudor Square]] developed with [[Wellcome Trust|Wellcome]]. Fun is a key element, and the festival holds many parties.<ref name="ypalex">Chris Bond, [http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/yorkshire-living/arts/cinema/documentary-evidence-of-a-golden-age-1-5718642 ''Documentary evidence of a golden age as festival opens window on the world'', ''The Yorkshire Post'', 30 May 2013]</ref> The festival has grown steadily over recent years.<ref name="sightsoundbestof">Nick Bradshaw, [http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/best-sheffield-docfest-2013 ''The best of Sheffield DocFest 2013'', ''Sight & Sound'', 10 July 2013]</ref> DocFest screenings help many films to achieve a wider audience by attracting distribution and further screening opportunities for the films it shows.<ref name="docgeekssubmissions">Alexandra Zeevalkink, [http://docgeeks.com/2012/10/30/sheffield-docfest-call-for-documentary-submissions%E2%80%A8/ ''Sheffield DocFest: call for documentary submissions '', docgeeks.com, 30 October 2012]</ref>

Sheffield DocFest's Marketplace & Talent is a major part of the Festival, which includes the MeetMarket for films and series to achieve funding and distribution, Alternate Realities Market for interactive and virtual reality projects, live pitches, and other training initiatives.

Interactive, immersive and virtual reality documentary is also a central element of the Festival with interactive exhibitions and commissioned works scattered across the city, and the Alternate Realities Summit taking place throughout an entire day of the Festival.



Sheffield DocFest is the perfect platform for anyone with an interest in interactive, virtual reality and factual content. DocFest prides itself in supporting and nurturing new talent: in addition to the Festival days in June, Sheffield DocFest presents All Year workshops, screenings, labs and mentoring opportunities both in the UK and internationally.

==History==

In 1990, Peter Symes of [[BBC Television|BBC TV]] Features [[Bristol]] had the idea of creating a forum for British documentary filmmakers to debate and discuss their craft. In 1993, he set up a festival board which included representatives from [[Channel 4]], [[United Artists]], [[Discovery Channel]], [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]] and [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]]. They chose to hold the festival in [[Sheffield]], an English industrial town which was just beginning to develop a media and cultural sector.<ref name="realscreenheather">Kevin Ritchie, [http://realscreen.com/2013/06/12/docfest-celebrates-its-second-decade/ ''DocFest celebrates its second decade''], ''realscreen.com'', 12 June 2013</ref>

The first Sheffield International Documentary Festival was held in 1994, formatted as an international film festival and conference for documentary professionals.<ref name="RegionalFilm">'20th Anniversary for Sheffield DocFest', ''Regional Film and Video'', 1 June 2013</ref> It included a film programme, one or two masterclasses, and a party.<ref name="quidnunc">'Quidnunc', ''Sheffield Telegraph'', 6 June 2013</ref> It lasted two days and mainly attracted London-based filmmakers and producers, plus several international commissioners and distributors.

Over the next eight years, the [[Festival]] continued with around 475-700 delegates attending, and total audiences reaching around 2000. The Festival became an opportunity for London-based independent filmmakers to talk to commissioners at the [[BBC]] and [[Channel 4]], who were otherwise difficult to reach. Success at the Festival might mean landing a job for the coming year.<ref name="realscreenheather" />

In 2005 DocFest attracted more than 600 mostly-UK delegates and enjoyed almost 9000 screening and session admissions. However, with changes in the factual television marketplace, it was time for DocFest to move from a primarily craft-based event, and increase its marketplace activity. The chairman at the time, [[Steve Hewlett (journalist)|Steve Hewlett]], visited the [[Australian International Documentary Conference]] (AIDC) where he met its director [[Heather Croall]], who had a background in filmmaking and had founded the [[cross-platform]] [[storytelling]] event DigiDocs. He invited Croall to come and work for the festival, where she was subsequently Festival Director & CEO until early 2015, turning around the Festival's fortunes.<ref name="sightsoundbestof" />

The 1990s rise in [[international co-production]]s meant that British producers could no longer rely solely on one big broadcaster for their entire budget, and instead had to look abroad to piece together financing for their films. To internationalise the Festival and help filmmakers achieve this financing, Croall introduced the MeetMarket [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] forum, where filmmakers pitch their ideas to funders in one-to-one meetings.  MeetMarket was developed with the help Karolina Lidin, Marketplace [[Executive Producer]] since 2008. In 2003, she developed the very first MeetMarket with Croall at [[Australian International Documentary Conference|AIDC]], which was later brought to [[Sheffield]] in 2006.

Croall also introduced the digital-focused Summit and Crossover Market, now Alternate Realities Market, which – like the MeetMarket – pairs [[buyer]]s and commissioners with game designers, [[Information technologist|technologist]]s, producers, digital agencies and filmmakers, all looking to tell stories in the interactive realm.

In 2007, Hussain Currimbhoy joined as programmer.<ref name="TheKnowledge">Paul Banks, [http://www.theknowledgeonline.com/the-knowledge-bulletin/post/2013/05/09/What-films-really-make-Sheffield-DocFests-Hussain-Currimbhoy-cry ''Fav docs of Sheffield DocFest's programmer''], ''The Knowledge'', 9 May 2013</ref>
 
In 2011 the Festival moved from November to June, to better fit into the industry calendar and ensure better weather and lighter evenings for visitors.

DocFest was an early advocate of [[crowdfunding]] as a source of [[finance]] for documentary filmmakers, and in 2010 staged its first festival-based [[crowdfunding]] pitching event, which was also an industry first.<ref>Alexandra Zeevalkink, [http://docgeeks.com/2012/10/04/sheffield-docfest-launches-crowdfunding-campaign/ ''Sheffield DocFest launches crowdfunding campaign''], docgeeks.com, 4 October 2012</ref><ref>Jennifer Merin, [http://documentaries.about.com/od/documentaryfestivals/a/Sheffield-Doc-Fest-S-Crowdfunding-Initiative.htm ''Sheffield Doc Fest's Crowdfunding Initiative''], about.com.

From 2012, selected highlights from the Festival have often played at the [[BFI Southbank]] in London.<ref name="moviescopeschedule">Chris Patmore, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131102161022/http://www.moviescopemag.com/featured-editorial/packed-schedule-for-sheffield-docfest-announced/ ''Packed schedule for Sheffield DocFest announced''], moviescopemag.com, 10 May 2013</ref> The Festival began producing its own film projects, including ''[[From the Sea to the Land Beyond]]'' in 2012 and ''[[The Big Melt]]'' in 2013.

From 2014, the [[Festival]] became recognised by the [[Academy Awards]] as an Oscar-qualifying festival in the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary (Short Subject)]] category<ref name="real2" /> with the DocFest Short Doc Award Winner eligible to enter for consideration. Many DocFest Short Doc Award-winning films have gone on to be shortlisted for Oscars.

In 2014 DocFest presented films including ''[[Beyond Clueless]]'' and ''[[Love Is All (band)|Love Is All]]'' at [[Latitude Festival]],<ref>Elisa Bray, ''A Festival For All The Senses'', ''The Independent'', 12 July 2014</ref> with [[Sigur Ros]] scored archive film ''[[The Show of Shows: 100 Years of Vaudeville, Circuses and Carnivals]]'', ''[[Montage of Heck]]'', ''Sounds of the Cosmos'' and a number of shorts also featured in 2015. This [[partnership]] has continued, and in 2017 DocFest brought a selection of [[virtual reality]] projects to [[Latitude Festival|Latitude]] for the first time, alongside a curated programme of shorts.<ref name=":6"></ref>

In 2014 there were some high level staff changes. [[Director (business)|Deputy Director]] [[Charlie Phillips (documentary films)|Charlie Phillips]] left to head up the documentary arm of [[The Guardian]], with director of [[Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival|Berwick Film & Media Arts Festival]] Melanie Iredale taking up the position.<ref name="Realscreen14">Adam Benzine, [http://realscreen.com/2014/09/08/docfest-hires-iredale-as-phillips-currimbhoy-depart/ ''DocFest hires Iredale as Phillips, Currimbhoy depart''], ''Realscreen'', 8 September 2014</ref> Director of Programming Hussain Currimbhoy left for [[Sundance Festival]] with former Executive Content Adviser at [[Independent Television Service (ITVS)]] Claire Aguilar becoming Head of Programming & Industry Engagement.<ref name="ScreenInernational">Sarah Cooper, [http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/claire-aguilar-joins-sheffield-doc/fest/5080981.article ''Claire Aguilar joins Sheffield DocFest''], ''Screen International'', 12 December 2014</ref> Croall returned to Australia to direct the [[Adelaide Fringe]].<ref name="heatherleaves">[http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/sheffield-doc/fest-director-to-step-down/5081453.article/ Sheffield DocFest director Heather Croall to step down], screendaily.com, 5 January 2015.

Following Heather's departure, Crossover Labs Director [[Mark Atkin]] stepped in as acting director for the 2015 [[Festival]], before Liz McIntyre of [[Discovery Networks]] joined as CEO & Festival Director from 1 September 2015.<ref name="broadcastliz">[http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/sheffield-doc/fest-hires-liz-mcintyre/5086796.article Sheffield DocFest hires Liz McIntyre], broadcastnow.co.uk, 21 April 2015.

Since McIntyre's appointment, the CEO & Festival Director has championed diverse and pluralist voices, inclusiveness and accessibility, for example creating a [[Day care|crèche]] service and introducing [[British Sign Language]] interpreted talks,<ref></ref> [[Dementia]]-friendly screenings,<ref></ref> Doc/Dinner for championing diverse talent within the industry,<ref name=":7"></ref> and a From Door to Doc, affording reduced rate entry to screenings for hard-to-reach areas of [[Sheffield]].<ref></ref>

The effect of the [[Festival]] on [[Sheffield]]'s [[economy]] is worth millions of pounds. Outside of the annual [[Festival]], there is now also a year-round programme, called DocFest All Year, providing training, educational and cultural activities across the UK, including a training initiative for aspiring [[Feature film|feature]] documentary producers called Future Producer School launched in 2014.<ref name="real3">Manori Ravindran [http://realscreen.com/2014/03/10/sheffield-docfest-launches-producer-school-pitch-competitions/ ''Sheffield DocFest launches producer school, pitch competitions''], realscreen.com, 10 March 2014.

== Marketplace & Talent ==

[[File:Meetmarket.jpg|thumb|right|Meetmarket]]

=== MeetMarket & Alternate Realities Market ===
MeetMarket & Alternate Realities Market is a [[documentary]] pitching event held at Sheffield DocFest, where filmmakers pitch their project ideas one-on-one to UK and international broadcasters, funders and distributors.

Former Festival Director [[Heather Croall]] introduced MeetMarket to DocFest in 2006 and developed it as an alternative to public pitching (where filmmakers pitch to a large audience).<ref name="screendailyheather">Michael Rosser, [http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/heather-croall-sheffield-doc/fest/5057158.article ''Heather Croall, Sheffield DocFest''], screendaily.com, 10 June 2013</ref> Each meeting is match-made and scheduled with relevant Decision Makers. Each year there are approximately 65 projects, which hold many one-to-one across two days.<ref name="screendailyrecord">Michael Rosser, [http://www.screendaily.com/news/sheffield-meetmarket-draws-record-pitches/5053496.article ''Sheffield DocFest's MeetMarket draws record pitches''], screendaily.com, 2 April 2013</ref> In 2017, the event was attended by 330 Decision Makers.

Since its introduction, nearly 10,800 meetings have taken place for 609 documentary and digital projects (as of July 2017).

All meetings held at MeetMarket have been requested by both parties, meaning it's more likely for a deal to be made. While the focus is on achieving funding and [[distribution (business)|distribution]], participants also benefit from advice on production, distribution, exhibition, marketing and outreach. Filmmaker [[Guy Davidi]] said "Pitching in intimate round-table sessions was a big comfort. It reduces tension and competitiveness and makes the whole thing much more relaxed and fun. We have created important connections and in one case it led directly to an investment."<ref name="broadcastreport">[http://sheffdocfest.com/attachments/177268/MeetMarket_Report_2006-2012.pdf ''MeetMarket report 2006-2012''] , ''Broadcast'', 2012. Retrieved 9 January 2014</ref>

In 2017, 63 projects from 22 countries, including new films from [[Michael Moore]], [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]], [[Kim Longinotto]], Dionne Walker, [[Laura Poitras]], and [[Jerry Rothwell]], and 24 Alternate Realities projects were selected, including works from Charlotte Mikkelborg, Richard Nockles, and INK Stories. 330 Decision Makers took part, including representatives from Submarine, [[BBC Earth]] VR, [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], [[National Film Board of Canada|The National Film Board of Canada]], [[Vice Media|VICE]], and Pulse Films.<ref></ref>

In 2016, 64 projects from 27 countries were chosen to participate, including new films from [[Orlando von Einsiedel]], [[Jennifer Brea]], [[Mike Lerner (filmmaker)|Mike Lerner]], Stefan Kloos, [[Nick Fraser]], Christoph Jorg, [[David Letterman]], Al Morrow, [[Jeanie Finlay]], [[André Singer (producer)|Andre Singer]], Amir Amiriani, and Catherine Allen. 25 Alternate Realities Market projects were chosen, including works from [[Katharine Round]], Alex Pearson, Darren Emerson, and [[Jennifer Brea]]. 313 Decision Makers took part in the MeetMarket, Alternate Realities Market and various other Marketplace initiatives from organisations including [[Red Bull]], [[Canal+]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]], [[National Geographic]], [[Google]], and [[Netflix]].<ref></ref>

In 2015, 64 projects from 19 countries were chosen to participate in MeetMarket from 600 submissions,<ref name="indiewire1" /> including new films from [[John Akomfrah]], [[Lindsey Dryden]] and [[Maheen Zia]]. 300 executives, distributors, commissioners, funders, advisors and buyers across [[documentary]] and [[digital media]] took part in the MeetMarket and Marketplace activity including [[The Guardian]], [[BBC]], [[Arte]], [[Dogwoof]] and [[Channel 4]].

In 2014, 64 projects were chosen to participate in MeetMarket,<ref name="indiewire1" /> including new films from [[Franny Armstrong]], [[William Karel]], and [[Stanley Nelson Jr.]] 290 investors, commissioners and production partners took part including commissioners from [[Netflix]], ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed]]'', ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', [[Vimeo]] and [[Nowness]] and distributors [[Oscilloscope Laboratories]], [[Dogwoof]] and [[PBS]].<ref name="real2" />

In 2013 MeetMarket attracted over 600 applications. Over 60 projects from 18 countries were chosen to participate. Filmmakers included [[Franny Armstrong]], [[Marshall Curry]], [[Jeanie Finlay]], [[Alex Gibney]], [[Phil Grabsky]], [[Brian Hill (director)|Brian Hill]], [[Victor Kossakovsky]] and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]].<ref name="realscreenheather" /> The selection also included six cross-platform projects.

MeetMarket films and Alternate Realities Market projects are tracked for success across awards and other [[film festival]]s. Films and projects have gone on to win awards at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]], [[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]], [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|IDFA]], [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival|Hot Docs]] and DocFest.<ref name="broadcastreport" />

Notable films to achieve funding through MeetMarket include [[Unrest (2017 film)|Unrest]] and Unrest VR,<ref></ref> [[Notes on Blindness]] and Notes on Blindness: Into Darkness,<ref></ref> Joshua Oppenheimer's ''[[The Act of Killing]]''<ref name="sightsoundbestof" /> and ''[[The Look of Silence]]'', ''[[Searching for Sugarman]]'', [[Jeanie Finlay]]'s ''[[The Great Hip Hop Hoax]]'',<ref>http://realscreen.com/2013/06/13/docfest-13-finlay-reveals-the-great-hip-hop-hoax/, Kelly Anderson, 'DocFest '13: Finlay reveals "The Great Hip Hop Hoax"', ''realscreen.com'', 13 June 2013</ref> ''[[Ping Pong (2012 film)|Ping Pong]]'', ''[[5 Broken Cameras]]'', and ''[[God Loves Uganda]]''.<ref>Michael Rosser, [http://www.screendaily.com/news/doc/fest-delegates-up-18/5057525.article Sheffield DocFest delegates up 18%], screendaily.com, 19 June 2013.

'''On-Screen Talent Market''' is a Sheffield DocFest initiative to connect charismatic subject-specialists with producers, commissioners, and other Decision Makers looking for fresh faces for their programmes. The programme includes an intensive morning training programme giving insight into the industry via first-hand encounters with established professionals, and is designed for the experts to hone their skills in presenting themselves to the media. This is followed by an afternoon of match-made one-to-one meetings between the talent and television executives. The programme is designed and delivered in collaboration with the Academic Ideas Lab.<ref></ref>

Doc/Dinner allows a group of emerging filmmakers to dine with industry executives to exchange ideas and expertise, hosted by Yates. In 2017, execs from the [[BBC]], [[Channel 4]], [[Vice Media|VICE]], Pulse Films and [[The Guardian]] met with 20 young filmmakers.<ref></ref>
