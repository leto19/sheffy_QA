'''Sheffield City Council''' is the [[city council]] for the [[Sheffield|metropolitan borough of Sheffield]] in [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]]. It consists of 84 councillors, elected to represent 28 [[ward (politics)|ward]]s, each with three councillors. It is currently under [[No overall control|No Overall Control]], with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] forming a co-operation agreement to jointly run the council.

==History==
The council was founded as the '''Corporation of Sheffield''' in 1843, when Sheffield was incorporated (see [[History of Sheffield]]). In 1889, it attained [[county borough]] status and in 1893 [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. In 1974, the [[Local Government Act 1972]], reconstituted the City Council as a [[metropolitan district]] council of [[South Yorkshire]], governed also by [[South Yorkshire County Council]]. It established a system of 90 councillors, three to each of 30 wards. This was reduced in 1980 with the merger of the Attercliffe and Darnall wards to 87 councillors in 29 wards.

In 1986, the [[Local Government Act 1985|abolition of metropolitan county councils]] saw Sheffield City Council effectively regain its county borough status.

In 2004, the local wards were completely reorganised, producing 28 new wards and 84 councillors.

In April 2014, the Sheffield City Council voted to recognize the right to self-determination of [[Somaliland]], an [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous region]] in northwestern [[Somalia]], the first city council to do so. The gesture is purely ceremonial and carries no legal weight.<ref name="Vshbsfiib"></ref> The UK government and the international community officially recognise Somaliland as a part of Somalia.

In August 2019, a governance petition was submitted to the council, asking for a referendum on changing the council's governance system.<ref></ref> The petition, organised by the Sheffield community group It's Our City!, was signed by over 26000 people (approximately 6.6% of the Sheffield City Council electorate). In September 2019 this petition was accepted as valid under the provisions of the [[Localism Act 2011]], forcing the council to hold a referendum on changing the council's [[executive arrangements]] from the Leader and Cabinet system to a Committee system.<ref></ref> The referendum was postponed from May 2020 (due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]) and took place on 6 May 2021, with 65% voting for change to a Committee system.<ref></ref>

==Political control==


For twenty years from 1846, [[Isaac Ironside]]'s [[Central Democratic Association]] was a force on the council.  It then returned to typical [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]–[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] rivalry.

[[Labour Party (UK)|The Labour Party]] made little impact in its early years; by 1918, there were only three Labour councillors (and two [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]], plus one Lib-Lab [[alderman]]).  That all changed in 1919, when Labour won almost all the seats up for election that year, giving them 12 councillors and their coalition partners the [[Co-operative Party]] two.  In response to their losses, the Conservative and Liberal groups merged to form the Citizens Association, retaining control with 32 councillors and 15 aldermen.  The Lib-Labs remained unchanged in numbers and politically between the two groups.<ref name="trades">J. Mendelson, W. Owen, S. Pollard and V. M. Thornes, ''The Sheffield Trades and Labour Council 1858 - 1958''</ref>

In the following years, Labour continued to advance at the expense of the Citizens Association.  By 1922, there were 18 Labour councillors and one alderman; by 1925, 22 councillors and one alderman.  At the 1926 elections, Labour rose to 29 councillors.  A majority on the council and a large number of retiring aldermen finally enabled them to take 8 positions on the aldermanic bench.<ref name="trades" />

The seats were redistributed into 24 wards in 1930, and the Citizens Association renamed itself the Progressive Party. A further seat was added for Norton in 1934, taking the total number of positions to 75 councillors and 25 aldermen.  That year, Labour briefly lost control, but regained it in 1934, with an increased majority of 12.  This rose to 14 the following year.  In 1945, Labour had 59 total seats to the Progressive's 39, one independent and one [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist]].  Labour continued to build its majority, to 34 in 1952 and 42 by 1958.<ref name="trades" />  However, it lost control to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], again standing on its own, in 1968-9.

The Council was reorganised under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] and in 1974, Aldermen were abolished, with elections to Sheffield City Council moving to 'thirds', and elections three years of every four, with terms lasting four years.

Despite these changes the council remained under Labour control until 1999, when the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] took control of the council. The Labour Party regained control of the Council in 2002 with power shifting back to the Liberal Democrats in 2008. During this period there were three years of No Overall Control; from 2002-03 (Labour Minority), 2007-08 (Labour Minority) and 2010-11 (Liberal Democrat Minority). However, Labour took control once again in 2011.

Following the 2021 elections the Council is now in No Overall Control.
