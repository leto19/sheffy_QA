The '''University of Sheffield''' (informally '''Sheffield University'''<ref></ref><ref></ref> or '''TUOS''')<ref></ref><ref></ref> is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], England. Its history traces back to the foundation of [[Sheffield Medical School]] in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884.<ref name="MATHERS"/> University College of Sheffield was subsequently formed by the amalgamation of the three institutions in 1897 and was granted a [[royal charter]] as University of Sheffield in 1905 by [[King Edward VII]].

Sheffield is formed from 50 academic departments which are organised into five faculties and an international faculty. The annual income of the institution for 2020–21 was £741 million, of which £163 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £708.6 million.<ref name="Sheffield Financial Statement 20/21"/> Sheffield ranks among the top 10 of UK universities for research grant funding,<ref name="timeshighereducation.com"></ref> and it has become number one in the UK for income and investment in engineering research according to new data published by the [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA).<ref></ref> It is one of the top 7 British universities by [[List of universities in the United Kingdom by enrolment#Universities and other higher education providers by size|postgraduate student enrollment]] along with [[University College London|UCL]], [[King's College London|King's]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref></ref>

The university is one of the original [[red brick universities]] and a founding member of the prestigious [[Russell Group]]. It is also part of the [[Worldwide Universities Network]], the [[N8 Group]] of the eight most research intensive universities in Northern England and the [[White Rose University Consortium]]. Sheffield has been ranked as a top 100 university in the world by [[QS World University Rankings|QS]] for the last fifteen years.<ref></ref> In 2019, Time Higher Education ranked the University 22nd in Europe for teaching excellence.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

There are eight Nobel laureates affiliated with Sheffield and six of them are the alumni or former long-term staff of the university.<ref></ref> They are contributors to the development of penicillin, the discovery of the citric acid cycle, the investigation of high-speed chemical reactions, the discovery of introns in eukaryotic DNA, the discovery of fullerene, and the development of molecular machines. Alumni also include several [[Head of state|Heads of state]], [[Home Secretary|Home Secretaries]], [[Court of Appeal judge (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal judges]], [[Booker Prize]] winners, [[astronaut]] and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medallists.

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:Firth Court, Sheffield University.jpg|thumb|259x259px|[[Firth Court]] is the main administrative centre of the university]]
[[File:Mark Firth by Thomas Jones Barker.jpg|180px|thumb|Former Master Cutler and Mayor of Sheffield [[Mark Firth]] opened Firth College in 1879]]
[[File:Arthur Stockdale Cope - William M. Hicks 1909.jpg|thumb|180px|[[William Mitchinson Hicks]] was the founding vice-chancellor of the University College of Sheffield]]

The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three local institutions: the Sheffield School of Medicine, Firth College, and the Sheffield Technical School. With a history dating back to as early as the 1810s, the Sheffield School of Medicine is the university's oldest predecessor institution, which is also the oldest higher education establishment in Sheffield. In 1795, the [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary|General Infirmary]] was opened, becoming the first hospital in the city. Because of the [[Apprenticeship|apprenticeship-type]] training, the medical education at that time was largely unstructured. Regarded as the father of Sheffield's medical education, surgeon apothecary Hall Overend began to train medical students in 1811.<ref></ref> His school of anatomy and medicine was externally recognised in 1828,<ref name="Overend"></ref> and he conducted and taught human dissection in an anatomy museum at his home in [[Church Street, Sheffield|Church Street]]. Overend, however, was not officially registered as a lecturer with the [[Society of Apothecaries]], a recognised body for medical education.<ref name = "med history"></ref> Physicians and surgeons of the General Infirmary suggested that a school associated with the hospital would be highly eligible for recognition by the society. As a result, in 1828, a public meeting was called by physician Sir Arnold Knight, and supported by Overend, to establish a new medical school. The Sheffield Medical Institution was formally opened a year later in 1829 on Surrey Street, with the Latin motto ''[[Ars longa vita brevis]]'' (Art is long, life is short), which refers to the difficulty to acquire and practice the art of Medicine.<ref></ref> Knight laid the foundation stone and delivered the opening lecture.<ref name = "Med Origins"></ref><ref name = "med history"/>

The University Extension Movement emerged in the 1870s with the aim of providing education in the city which lacked any tertiary institutions.<ref></ref> During the period, the steel industry in Sheffield was prospering and the city's population was doubled to around 240,000 from the 1840s.<ref name="MATHERS"/> In 1871, the university extension scheme arrived in Sheffield, and a group of lecturers from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge travelled to the city giving lectures and educating people about the benefits of tertiary education. Steel manufacturer and former Mayor of Sheffield [[Mark Firth]] and clergyman [[Samuel Earnshaw]] therefore organised courses in English literature and political economy. The courses became popular so Firth decided to donate £20,000 and purchase a site in the city centre (now Leopold Street and West Street) in 1877 to build a new institution for the classes.<ref name="MATHERS"/> Firth College was founded during Firth's late year in 1879 and developed out of the Extension Movement scheme to teach arts and pure science subjects.<ref></ref> The college saved the medical school, which had an insecure early history, from collapse and took over the teaching of all background subjects to medical students.<ref name="Historical note"></ref> In 1888 the medical school was relocated, opposite Firth College, to a new building on Leopold Street.<ref name = "Med Origins"/>

Firth College also helped to fund the opening of the Sheffield Technical School in 1884 to teach applied science, the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The Sheffield Technical School was created by collecting funds within Firth College because of local concern about the need for technical training, particularly steelmaking in Sheffield. Former Mayor of Sheffield [[Sir Frederick Mappin, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Mappin]] started to fundraise for the school and £10,240 was raised.<ref name=Legacy></ref> A grant was secured in 1883 to fund a professor of Metallurgy and Mechanical Engineering.<ref name="MATHERS"/> Many of the steel-making firms in Sheffield contributed to funding the Technical School, and research from the school in turn helped develop new processes and products for the companies.<ref></ref> The Technical School was originally founded as a new technical department in Firth College, and in 1886, the school moved to St George's Square (later renamed Charlotte Street and now Mappin Street) on the site of the old [[Sheffield Grammar School|Grammar School]].<ref name="Historical note"/> [[William Ripper]] was appointed as Head of Mechanical Engineering at Firth College from 1889, then Principal of Sheffield Technical School.

===Foundation===
Sheffield was at that time the only large city in England without a university. [[William Mitchinson Hicks]], who was Principal of Firth College from 1892 to 1897, had an ambition to establish a university in the city.<ref name="Hicks"></ref> As a first stage of his ideal, Hicks was devoted to the union of the three higher education institutions in Sheffield and to transform Firth College into a [[university college]]. He also extended the college by creating new departments and adding new buildings.<ref name="Hicks"/> In 1897, Firth College merged with the Medical School and the Technical School to form the University College of Sheffield, and Hicks served as its first principal.<ref name="MATHERS"/><ref name="Historical note"/> Six years since the foundation of the university college, on 18 May 1903, the resolution to apply for a [[royal charter]] was passed.<ref name="birthday"></ref> The university college started to develop its estate soon after: Western House by Weston Park on Western Bank was bought and demolished in 1903 for building a new university property.<ref name="birthday"/> A building with a traditional collegiate quadrangle (later known as Western Bank building and now Firth Court) was planned on the site.<ref name="birthday"/> Sir Frederick Mappin later successfully sought financial support from the Sheffield City Council and appealed for public donations.<ref name="birthday"/> In 1904, steelworkers, coal miners, factory workers and the people of Sheffield donated over £50,000 via penny donations to help found the University of Sheffield.<ref></ref>

[[File:Sheffieldunifundrasingposter.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The poster which helped raise funds for the university (1904–1905)]]

It was originally envisaged that the university college would join [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] as the fourth member of the federal [[Victoria University (United Kingdom)|Victoria University]]. The new university was proposed to be named "Victoria University of Yorkshire" by Leeds<ref></ref> but was rejected by the Privy Council.<ref></ref> The Victoria University, however, began to split up as independent universities before this could happen, when Liverpool gained a charter of its own in 1903. Rather than joining a Yorkshire university with Leeds, the University College of Sheffield was driven by civic pride to pursue independent university status,<ref name="birthday"/> to bring higher education, give support to industries and serve as a centre for disease study. Hicks also advocated the independent degree awarding power would attract talented staff.<ref name="MATHERS"/> The University College of Sheffield's charter was sealed on 31 May 1905 and became the University of Sheffield.<ref name="birthday"/> On 12 July 1905, Firth Court on Western Bank was opened by [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]. St George's Square remained the centre of departments of Applied Science, and the departments of Arts, Medicine and Science moved to Western Bank.<ref name="Historical note"/> Sheffield is one of the six pre-World War One [[red brick universities]], the civic universities founded in the major industrial cities of England.

===20th century===
In 1905, when the university first opened, there were 363 students<ref name ="tour"></ref> and 114 of them were enrolled full-time.<ref name="Historical note"/> Sheffield at the time had 71 members of staff.<ref name ="tour"/> By then, the first Hall of Residence (Stephenson Hall) and library (Edgar Allen library) had been established. The number of students increased to a short-lived peak of 1,000 in 1919 when returning ex-servicemen were admitted to the university. During the [[First World War]], some of the academic subjects and courses were replaced by teaching of munitions making and medical appliances production.<ref name="Historical note"/> The university has expanded since the 1920s from two ends on Western Bank and on the St George's site.<ref name=cmpart2></ref> The number of full time students was stabilized at about 750 between the two world wars.<ref name="Historical note"/> In 1943, the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] announced that universities in the UK should look forward to expansion in the years after the [[Second World War]].<ref name="CMp20"></ref> Sheffield predicted a 50% increase in student population but the university was unprepared for such growth. There was pressure on the university to expand since the student numbers had increased from around 1,000 to 3,000 by 1946.<ref name="CMp20"/> The university announced proposals for development in 1947, which emphasised the need for new departments, medical school, library, administration building, halls of residence, as well as the completion of the Western Bank quadrangle and the extension of the Students' Union.<ref name="CMp20"/>

The university then grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly. Many new buildings (including the [[Western Bank Library|Main Library]] and the [[Arts Tower]]) were built and older houses were brought into academic use. Student numbers increased to their present levels of just under 26,000. At the same time in the 1950s, the university was expanding at other sites, including the St Georges area.<ref name=cmpart2/> From the 1960s, many more buildings have been constructed or extended, including the Union of Students and St George's Library. The campus master plan proposed in the 1940s was completed by the 1970s, and the university required a new development plan.<ref name="CM"></ref>

The 1980s saw the opening of many new buildings and centres, such as the multi-purpose [[Octagon Centre]] and the Sir Henry Stephenson Building. The university's teaching hospital, [[Northern General Hospital]], was also extended.<ref name="CMp20"/> In 1987 the university began to collaborate with its once would-be partners of the Victoria University by co-founding the [[NCUK|Northern Consortium]]; a coalition for the education and recruitment of international students.<ref name="Historical note"/> The university continued to expand in the 1990s. New premises were opened for School of the Clinical Dentistry, the Division of Education, and the Management School.<ref name="CMp20"/> In 1995, the university took over the Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming a new School of Nursing and Midwifery. The St George's Hospital was extended and a new building at the Northern General Hospital has been constructed, which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty.

[[Hans Adolf Krebs]] was appointed as lecturer in Pharmacology in 1935. At Sheffield Krebs and his postgraduate student discovered the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle) in 1937,<ref></ref><ref></ref> which earned him a Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology for 1953. In 1938, the university opened the Department of Biochemistry (renamed since the 1990s as the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology) and Krebs became its first Head. Krebs Institute, a research centre for mechanistic biology, was founded in 1988 within the Department of Biochemistry. [[George Porter]] joined the university as Professor of Physical Chemistry in 1955 and he further developed his later Nobel Prize-winning work [[flash photolysis]] at Sheffield. Porter was appointed Firth Professor of Chemistry and became Head of the Department of Chemistry in 1963.<ref></ref>

===21st century===
In the 21st century, the university opened many more major buildings in the area immediately to the east and west of [[Upper Hanover Street]], such as the Jessop Building, the Soundhouse, [[Jessop West]] and the [[Information Commons, Sheffield|Information Commons]]. The Arts Tower building, the Students' Union and University House buildings, the [[Sheffield Bioincubator]] and University Health Centre were also refurbished. A new campus, North Campus, was opened.<ref name="Historical note"/> In 2003, a development framework was produced by Turnberry Consulting, with proposals aimed to densify the campus.<ref name = "main campus"/><ref></ref> In 2005, the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority announced that it would split the training between Sheffield and [[Sheffield Hallam University]] – however, the university decided to pull out of providing preregistration nursing and midwifery training due to "costs and operational difficulties".<ref name="guardian-nursing"></ref> On 28 September 2015, a new six-storey building, [[The Diamond, Sheffield|the Diamond]], was opened.<ref></ref>

In February 2016, the university started to work with [[Sheffield City Council]] to transform public spaces around the campus.<ref name=transforming></ref> The £8&nbsp;million project includes building and improving pedestrianisation, crossings, cycle routes, as well as greening the campus.<ref name=transforming/><ref></ref> The university intended to expand the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and provision for apprenticeships; however, while the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership recommended that the £10 million funding bid should be approved, the university withdrew the bid in November 2018.<ref></ref> The University Concourse was refurbished in 2019 to replace the 50-year-old paving and walls.<ref></ref> Major development projects in the 2020s include constructions of a new Information School building (Northumberland Road Building), Social Sciences Building, Royce Discovery Centre, energy centre (the Transformer), Translational Energy Research Centre, and redevelopment of the original [[Henderson's Relish#Factory|Henderson's factory]].<ref name=estate></ref>

The University of Sheffield is not a [[campus university]], though most of its 430 buildings are located in fairly close proximity to each other.<ref name=estate/> It is divided geographically by the [[Sheffield Inner Ring Road]].<ref name = "campus master plan"></ref> The Upper Hanover Street section of the ring road splits university buildings into the Western Bank and the St George's campus areas. 
Instead of growing from a single centre, since receiving its Royal Charter, the university has expanded from two academic foci about 1&nbsp;km apart: Firth Court on Western Bank and Sir Frederick Mappin Building on St George's. The two foci started to fuse in the 1960s, as more buildings have been constructed or acquired by the university. The completion of the [[Information Commons, Sheffield|Information Commons]] and Jessop West buildings, in the late 2000s, bridges both west (Western Bank) and east (St George's) campus,<ref name = "campus master plan"/> and in 2017, a new pedestrian crossing was installed on the Upper Hanover Street, physically connecting the two campus.<ref name = "campus master plan"/>

The university campus is composed of an eclectic range of buildings from [[Victorian architecture|Victorian style]] to [[modern architecture|modernism]] to [[contemporary architecture|contemporary]]. [[Sir Frederick Mappin Building]] and Central Block are two Victorian university buildings, now linked by a contemporary curved glass roof constructed in 2020. Opened as the Western Bank Building, [[Firth Court]] is a red brick Edwardian building in Perpendicular Revival style,<ref name="List Entry"></ref> and is connected to the 1971 modernist [[Alfred Denny Building]]. The nearby [[Arts Tower]] is also an example of postwar modernist building in the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]].<ref></ref> The Diamond, a contemporary architecture designed by Twelve Architects, is situated next to the Victorian Jessop Building on the former site of Jessop's Edwardian wing.<ref></ref>

A total of 36 university estate are [[listed building|listed]].<ref name = "campus master plan"/> Of these, the Arts Tower and Western Bank Library are Grade II* listed buildings. Firth Court, Mappin Building, St George's Church, Jessop Building and the [[Drama Studio, University of Sheffield|Drama Studio]] are listed Grade II.

===Main (Western Bank) Campus===

The centre of the university's presence lies one mile to the west of Sheffield city centre, where there is a mile-long collection of buildings belonging almost entirely to the university. This main campus area<ref name = "main campus"></ref> is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the east, Glossop Road to the south, Clarkson Street to the west, and Bolsover Street to the north. Western Bank ([[A57 road|A57]]) runs through the campus.<ref name = "campus master plan"/> The area to the north of Western Bank includes [[Firth Court]], [[Alfred Denny Building]], [[Western Bank Library]] and [[Arts Tower]], Geography and Planning building, [[Bartolomé House]], and Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings. Within the southern area of the campus are the [[University of Sheffield Union of Students|Sheffield Students' Union]], the [[Octagon Centre]], Graves Building and [[Hicks Building]].<ref name="Campus map"></ref> A concourse under the A57 flyover connects Alfred Denny Building on the north side and Students' Union on the south. Until the completion of three pedestrian crossings on Western Bank in 2017, the concourse underpass was the only link that allowed students to easily move between buildings in this cluster.<ref></ref> The Information Commons, a library and computing centre opened in 2007, is also located at the Western Bank Campus on Leavygreave Road. In addition, throughout 2010 the Western Bank Library received a £3.3 million restoration and refurbishment, the [[University of Sheffield Union of Students]] underwent a £5 million rebuild, and work commenced on a multimillion-pound refurbishment of the Grade II* listed [[Arts Tower]] to extend its lifespan by 30 years.<ref></ref>

===St George's Campus===
To the east of the main campus lies St George's campus, named after [[St George's Church, Portobello|St George's Church]] (now a lecture theatre and postgraduate residence). The campus is the historical location of the Sheffield Technical School. It is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the west, Broad Lane to the north, Rockingham Street to the east, and West Street to the south,<ref name = "campus master plan"/> and is part of [[St George's Quarter]], one of the seven official Sheffield city centre quarters.<ref>[http://sccplugins.sheffield.gov.uk/urban_design/quarters_georges.htm Sheffield City Council Quarters plan] </ref> Also known as the Engineering campus,<ref name="Engineering campus"></ref> St George's campus is centred on Mappin Street, the location of the Faculty of Engineering (partly housed in the [[Listed building|Grade II-listed]] [[Mappin Building]]) and the Department of Journalism Studies, Department of Economics and Department of [[Computer Science]]. The university also maintains the [[Turner Museum of Glass]] in this area. As part of the 2000s development plan, the university has converted the listed [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Jessop Hospital|Jessop Hospital for Women]] into the new home of the Department of Music in 2009. The formerly Grade II-listed Edwardian wing of the Jessop Hospital was demolished after Sheffield City Council's planning committee voted for approval.<ref></ref> The building was replaced by a new £81 million building for the Faculty of Engineering which opened in September 2015, named the [[The Diamond, Sheffield|Diamond]]. It is a purpose-built multi-disciplinary building that houses lecture theatres, laboratories, workrooms and other facilities for the teaching of engineering.<ref name=StarDiamond></ref><ref></ref> Amongst the more recent additions to the university's estate located on this campus are the Soundhouse (2008; a music practice and studio facility) and the [[Jessop West]] building (2009; the first UK project by Berlin architects [[Sauerbruch Hutton]]).<ref></ref>

The [[Sir Frederick Mappin Building]] is a Grade II-listed building in an area known as the St George's Complex. The building houses much of the Faculty of Engineering and St George's IT centre.<ref name="Campus landmarks"></ref> Completed in 1885, the oldest part of the building, the former Sheffield Technical School, now the Central Wing, lies in the centre of the building. The extensive Mappin Street frontage includes the main entrance, the John Carr Library and Mappin Hall, and is connected to the Central Wing by a bridge. In early 2020, the Mappin Building and the Central Wing were refurbished. As a result of the refurbishments, the two buildings are joint by an award-winning quadruple-height atrium with curved glass roof.<ref></ref> The atrium, called the Engineering Heartspace, houses laboratories, offices and social spaces.<ref name="Engineering campus"/>

Given its name to the campus, [[St George's Church, Portobello|St George's Church]] was the first of three commissioners' churches to be built in Sheffield under the Church Building Act 1818. It was built in the Perpendicular style. The church closed in 1981 and was acquired by the university. It was converted for use as a lecture theatre in 1994,<ref name="Pevsner">Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004) ''Pevsner City Guides: Sheffield'', p88. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. </ref> while the upstairs has been converted for use as student accommodation.

===Other sites===
Further west lies Weston Park, the [[Weston Park Museum]], the [[Harold Cantor Gallery]], university's sports facilities [[Goodwin Sports Centre]] in the [[Crookesmoor]] area, and the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health around the [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]] (although these subjects are taught in the city's extensive teaching hospitals under the [[Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], and throughout [[South Yorkshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]]). It is in this area that the new £12 million Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), opened by Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in November 2010, is located.<ref></ref> There is a cluster of buildings located to the north of Broad Lane, opposite St George's campus, collectively called the north campus. Kroto Research Institute, [[Kroto Innovation Centre]], Nanoscience and Technology Building, Graduate Research Centre, George Porter Building and the International College are based on this campus area.<ref></ref> To the south of the city on Warminster Road are where the sports pitches at Norton Sports Park located.<ref></ref> The university also operates Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres (AMRCs) on the border of Sheffield, in [[Rotherham]] and Lancashire.<ref></ref> The Conference Centre and Teaching Hall at Philadelphia Campus of St. Thomas' Church are used as exam venues by the university.<ref></ref>

===Former locations===
The old Firth College building was built in 1879 at the corner of Leopold Street and West Street. It was designed by [[Flockton (architects)|Thomas James Flockton]] and [[Edward Robert Robson]] with the front facing West Street. Firth College moved out of the building following the establishment of the university. The building later housed the [[Sheffield Central Technical School]] and is currently home to Education Committee offices of Sheffield City Council.<ref></ref> Situated on 7 Leopold Street opposite Firth College, the old Medical School building was designed by John Dodsley Webster and completed in 1888. The school moved to Firth Court in 1905 and the building is now used as offices.<ref></ref>

The Manvers campus, at [[Wath-on-Dearne]] between Rotherham and [[Barnsley]], was where the majority of nursing was taught. A three-storey building, Humphry Davy House (named after chemist [[Humphry Davy]]), was built in 1998 on Golden Smithies Lane opposite to [[Dearne Valley College]].<ref name = "Rotherham"/> The building was home to the School of Nursing and Midwifery, which was established in 1995 after the merger of the university with Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery.<ref></ref> In 2004, the university disagreed with the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority's decision to take away part of its nursing and midwifery training contract, and declined the offer due to financial and operational constraints.<ref name="guardian-nursing"/> The last intake of midwifery studies students was in July 2006, and the campus was closed one year later.<ref name = "Rotherham"></ref> The building was sold in 2018 and to be converted for residential lettings.<ref></ref>

==Organisation==
===Faculties and departments===
Sheffield had four faculties in 1905, which were Arts, Pure Science, Medicine and Applied Science. The Faculty of Applied Science later split into Engineering and Metallurgy in 1919.<ref name="Historical note"/> As well as educating full-time students, in the early 20th century, the university taught non-degree courses that covered non-conventional, occupation-focused subjects such as cow-keeping, railway economics, mining and razor-grinding.<ref name="Historical note"/>

The university has currently five faculties comprising 50 departments and 82 research centres and institutes,<ref></ref> plus an international faculty.<ref name=Faculties></ref> The current faculty structure is:

====Faculty of Arts and Humanities====
The Faculty of Arts and Humanities is made up of eight schools and departments. It is also home to three institutes (Humanities Research Institute, Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies, and Digital Humanities Institute) and 16 research centres. The [[Centre for Research into Freemasonry and Fraternalism]] of the faculty was the first centre devoted to scholarly research into [[Freemasonry]] in a UK university.<ref></ref> The centre was closed in 2010, ten years after its establishment, due to its failure to capture substantial grants to support the centre's activities.<ref></ref> In May 2021, [[Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield|archaeology]] staff at the university have been told their jobs could be at risk after a review. A petition to save the department has gathered more than 35,000 signatures but the university said no decisions had yet been taken, but later changed to announcing they intended to dissolve the department, which was met with international outcry.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

====Faculty of Engineering====

The precursor to the Faculty of Engineering is the Sheffield Technical School established in the 1880s, which offered part-time and evening class programme to adults working in the steel industry.<ref name="Engineering history"></ref> During 1917, departments of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering and Mechanical Engineering were founded in response to the needs of the First World War. The departments provided training courses for injured and incapacitated soldiers, and manufactured inspection gauges and munition shells.<ref name="Engineering history"/> The Faculty of Engineering has now over 6,700 students and 1,000 staff.<ref></ref> Over 90% of the research from the department was rated as 4* (world-leading) or 3* (internationally excellent).<ref></ref>

====Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health====
The Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health is made up of four schools, including the Medical School, Health Sciences School, School of Clinical Dentistry and School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR). The [[Sheffield Medical School|Medical School]] is the oldest school of the university. It operated independently as the Sheffield School of Medicine until its mergers with Firth College and with Sheffield Technical School.<ref name=history></ref> The Medical School is located next to the [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]], one of the Sheffield's teaching hospitals, and the school is associated with [[Sheffield Children's Hospital]], [[Northern General Hospital]], [[Weston Park Hospital]] and [[Charles Clifford Dental Hospital]]. It is one of 32 bodies entitled to award medical degrees in the United Kingdom by the General Medical Council (GMC), the body responsible for registering doctors to practise medicine as well as regulating medical education and training in the United Kingdom.<ref name="GMC"></ref>

====Faculty of Science====
The Faculty of Science comprises seven classical science departments: Animal and Plant Sciences, Biomedical Science, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Physics and Astronomy, and Psychology.  All of the university's six [[Nobel Laureate]]s have been affiliated with this faculty.<ref name ="Nobel"/>

The Department of Animal and Plant Sciences is one of the largest departments dedicated for whole-organism biology studies in the UK.<ref></ref> Biology has been taught in Sheffield since 1884 in Firth College.
