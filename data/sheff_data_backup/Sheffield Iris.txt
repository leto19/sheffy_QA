The '''''Sheffield Iris''''' was an early weekly [[newspaper]] published on Tuesdays<ref name="memoirs">[[James Montgomery (poet)|James Montgomery]], [[John Holland (poet)|John Holland]] and James Everett, ''Memoirs of the Life and Writings of James Montgomery''</ref> in [[Sheffield]], [[England]].

The first newspaper to be published in Sheffield to see any degree of success was the ''Sheffield Weekly Journal'' in 1754.  This was bought out in 1755 by the ''Sheffield Weekly Register'', and was thereafter published in [[Doncaster]].<ref name="vickers">J. E. Vickers, ''A Popular History of Sheffield''</ref>

==''Sheffield Register''==
The '''''Sheffield Register''''' was the next newspaper to be established in the town.  It was founded by [[Joseph Gales, Sr.|Joseph Gales]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], who supported various [[radicalism (historical)|Radical]] causes, advocating [[religious tolerance]], Parliamentary [[reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], and opposed [[boxing]] and [[bull-baiting]].<ref name="odnb">"Gales, Joseph", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

In June 1787, he began publishing the ''Sheffield Register'', initially in partnership with David Martin,<ref name="leader">[[R. E. Leader]], ''[http://youle.info/history/fh_material/18C_sheffield/ch14.txt Reminiscences of Sheffield]''</ref> from offices in Hartshead.<ref name="vickers" /> James Montgomery denied that he or Joseph Gales met Thomas Paine at this time (Holland, John, and James Everett. Memoirs of the life and writings of James Montgomery. 7 vols. London: Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1854-56.1:79; 1:156n). The newspaper focussed on reporting local news, and on reprinting tracts by reformers such as Paine and [[Joseph Priestley]]. This was a novelty, as most provincial newspapers of the day simply reprinted stories from the London press.

In 1789, Martin left the partnership.<ref name="leader" /> Gales' politics became more prominent, and the newspaper celebrated the [[French Revolution]] and acted as the mouthpiece of the [[Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information]], an artisan-based political organisation established by Gales in 1791 which called for radical reforms.<ref name="odnb" />

The ''Register'' was extremely popular in the early 1790s, selling up to 2,000 copies of each issue. Gales established a companion fortnightly political journal, ''The Patriot'', in 1792.<ref name="odnb" /> The same year, the poet [[James Montgomery (poet)|James Montgomery]] was appointed as clerk and bookkeeper for the newspaper offices.<ref name="montgomery">"Montgomery, James", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

In 1794, the Government began arresting leaders of the Corresponding Societies, and Gales wrote articles decrying this. Gales was suspected of writing a letter offering to sell [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s to the London society, but was on business in [[Derby]] when troops arrived to arrest him.<ref name="leader" /><ref name="bloy">Marjorie Bloy, [http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/18reform/sheffcorr.htm The Sheffield Corresponding Society]</ref>

Alarmed as to his safety, Gales published his final issue of the ''Register'', before fleeing to [[Hamburg]] in [[Germany]].  His wife Winifred remained behind to sell the ''Register'' to Montgomery,<ref name="odnb" /> who relaunched the newspaper as the ''Sheffield Iris'' and adopted a less radical editorial line. Montgomery initially used capital supplied by the Unitarian minister Benjamin Naylor.<ref name="montgomery" />

==''Sheffield Iris''==
Despite moderating the newspaper's line, Montgomery was prosecuted for [[sedition]] in 1795 for publishing a poem on a handbill which celebrated the fall of the [[Bastille]], and was sentenced to three months in prison. On his release, he negotiated Naylor's withdrawal and became sole proprietor. In August, he wrote a report offering mild criticism of an incident in Norfolk Street, where a popular protest was attacked by a [[militia]], resulting in two deaths. He was again prosecuted, this time for malicious [[libel]], and was imprisoned for six months.<ref name="montgomery" />  While he was in prison, [[John Pye-Smith]] took over as editor, and kept the paper running.<ref>[http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/lect2002.htm Bibliographical Society, 2002-2003] </ref> On Christmas Eve 1816 the paper published Montgomery's carol, "[[Angels from the Realms of Glory]]", which was to become one of the most popular Christmas carols sung in England.

The ''Iris'' remained a successful newspaper, but Montgomery developed other interests and, in the face of increased competition, from the ''[[Sheffield and Rotherham Independent]]'' and the ''[[Sheffield Mercury]]'', he sold it in to local bookseller John Blackwell in 1825.<ref name="vickers" /><ref name="montgomery" />  Blackwell appointed the poet [[John Holland (poet)|John Holland]] as editor, and despite frequently expressing his dislike for the role, Holland spent much of the rest of his life as a newspaper editor.<ref>J.

Stainton, ''[http://youle.info/history/fh_material/Making_of_Sheffield/13-LIVES.TXT The Making of Sheffield, 1865&ndash;1914]'' (1924)</ref>  The ''Iris'' ceased publication in 1848.<ref name="memoirs" />

A ''Sheffield Iris'' newspaper was briefly revived in 1855, following the removal of [[stamp duty]], but lasted only until the following year.<ref name="memoirs" /><ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~engsheffield/webpages/newspapers.htm </ref>
