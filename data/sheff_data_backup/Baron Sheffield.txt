'''Baron Sheffield''' is a title that has been created four times: once in the [[Peerage of England]], twice in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], and once in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].

The '''first creation''', as ''Baron Sheffield of Butterwick'', was in the Peerage of England in 1547 for [[Edmund Sheffield, 1st Baron Sheffield of Butterwick|Edmund Sheffield]] (1521–1549), second cousin of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who was murdered in [[Norwich]] during [[Kett's Rebellion]]. His grandson, the 
[[Edmund Sheffield, 1st Earl of Mulgrave|3rd Baron Sheffield]], was created ''[[Earl of Mulgrave]]'' in 1626, and the [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|3rd Earl of Mulgrave]] was finally advanced to the ''[[Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|dukedom of Buckingham and Normanby]]''. In 1735, at the death of the [[Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby]], however, all of the titles became extinct since no heirs to them remained.

The next three creations were all in favour of one person, [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|John Baker-Holroyd]] (1735–1821). In 1781, on the '''second creation''' of the title, he was made ''Baron Sheffield, of Dunnamore in the County of Meath'' in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. This peerage was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. Two years later, in 1783, John Baker-Holroyd obtained the '''third creation''' of the title when he was made ''Baron Sheffield, of Roscommon in the County of Roscommon'', also in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], with remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to the heirs male of his daughters from his first marriage. On the '''fourth creation''' of a Sheffield barony in 1802, John Baker-Holroyd was created ''Baron Sheffield, of [[Sheffield]] in the County of York,'' in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. In 1816 the same John Baker-Holroyd was further made ''[[Earl of Sheffield]]'' and ''[[Viscount Pevensey]]'' in the Peerage of Ireland. The latter titles were all created with remainder to the heirs male of his body. He was succeeded by his son from his second marriage.

On the death in 1909 of the [[Henry Holroyd, 3rd Earl of Sheffield|3rd Earl of Sheffield]], his earldom, the Pevensey viscountcy and the Sheffield baronies of 1781 and 1802 became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the Sheffield barony of 1783 according to special remainder by [[Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley]], who was also [[Baron Eddisbury|3rd Baron Eddisbury]] and now became 4th Baron Sheffield as well. The 4th Baron Sheffield was the grandson of Lady Maria Josepha Holroyd, daughter of the 1st Earl of Sheffield. These titles remain extant and united, see [[Baron Stanley of Alderley]] for further succession.
