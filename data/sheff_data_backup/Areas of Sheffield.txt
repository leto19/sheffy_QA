The '''areas of [[Sheffield]]''', a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[metropolitan borough]] in the north of [[England]], vary widely in size and history. Some of the areas developed from villages or [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]], that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew, and thus their centres are well defined, but the boundaries of many areas are ambiguous. The areas of Sheffield do not play a significant administrative role, but the city is divided into 28 electoral wards for local elections and 6 parliamentary constituencies for national elections.

==History==
Prior to 1848 the parish of Sheffield was divided into six townships: Attercliff-cum-Darnall; Brightside Bierlow; Ecclesall Bierlow; Nether Hallam; Sheffield township; and Upper Hallam. In 1832 the new [[Sheffield (UK Parliament constituency)|borough constituency of Sheffield]] was formed from these townships with the exception of most of Upper Hallam and parts of Ecclesall Bierlow. In 1843 the [[Municipal Borough]] of Sheffield was created from the whole of the six townships, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. The Sheffield constituency was broken into five divisions in 1885: [[Sheffield Attercliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Attercliffe]]; [[Sheffield Brightside (UK Parliament constituency)|Brightside]]; [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Central]]; [[Sheffield Ecclesall (UK Parliament constituency)|Ecclesall]]; and [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Hallam]], with the addition of [[Sheffield Hillsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Hillsborough]] and [[Sheffield Park (UK Parliament constituency)|Park]] constituencies in 1918 after the City extended its boundaries. The Central and Ecclesall constituencies were abolished in 1950 in favour of two new constituencies, [[Sheffield Heeley (UK Parliament constituency)|Heeley]] and [[Sheffield Neepsend (UK Parliament constituency)|Neepsend]], but the latter was abolished in 1955 and the former was replaced by a revived Central constituency in 1983.

Sheffield is divided into 28 electoral [[ward (politics)|wards]] for the purposes of [[Sheffield City Council|City Council]] elections.<ref name="scc"></ref> The number of electors per ward was set at about 13,500 Â± 10% in 2004, following a Local Government ward boundary review.<ref name="jgh1">[http://mdfs.net/maps/Sheffield/lgbr2002/ Summary of Sheffield 2004 Ward Boundary Review].
