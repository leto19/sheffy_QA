The '''Dean of Sheffield''' is the head (''primus inter pares'' – first among equals) and chair of the chapter of canons, the ruling body of [[Sheffield Cathedral]]. The dean and chapter are based at the ''Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul'' in [[Sheffield]]. Before 2000 the post was designated as a [[Provost (religion)|provost]], which was then the equivalent of a [[Dean (religion)|dean]] at most [[List of cathedrals in the United Kingdom|English cathedrals]]. The cathedral is the mother church of the [[Diocese of Sheffield]] and seat of the [[Bishop of Sheffield]].
