'''Edmund Sheffield, 1st Baron Sheffield''', of [[West Butterwick|Butterwick]] (22 November 1521 &ndash; 19 July 1549) was an [[English people|English]] [[nobleman]], the son of Sir Robert Sheffield (died 15 November 1531, son of Robert Sheffield and Helen Delves) and his second wife Jane Stanley, daughter of [[George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange]] and [[Joan le Strange, 9th Baroness Strange]]. Through his mother, he was a [[cousin chart|second cousin once removed]] of the reigning English monarch, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].

==Life==
Following his father's death in 1531, his [[Ward (law)|wardship]] was granted to [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford]], the brother of Henry VIII's [[Wives of Henry VIII|second wife]], [[Anne Boleyn]]. However, both Rochford and Boleyn were executed in 1536, and his wardship was transferred to [[John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford|John de Vere]], the fifteenth [[Earl of Oxford]].

Sheffield married Anne de Vere, daughter of [[John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford]], before 31 January 1538, and by her had a son and three daughters. In 1547 he was raised to the [[Peerage of England]] as ''[[Baron Sheffield]] of Butterwick''. Two years later, during [[Kett's Rebellion]] in [[Norwich]], Lord Sheffield was killed in a street near the [[Cathedral Close]] when he fell from his horse, removed his helmet assuming the customary capture and eventual ransom, yet was fatally struck by a butcher.<ref>Strype, John, ''Ecclesiastical Memoirs'', vol.2 part 1, Oxford (1822), 272.</ref>
