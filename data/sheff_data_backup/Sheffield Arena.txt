Opened in 1991, it is used for concerts and sporting events, and is also home to the [[Sheffield Steelers]] [[ice hockey]] club. Attendance for all events at the venue has totalled around 14&nbsp;million since its opening. It has a maximum capacity of 13,600.<ref></ref>

==History==
[[File:1993 Sheffield Arena queue 1 (14877204155).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Spectators queuing outside the arena in 1993]]
Constructed at a cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]34&nbsp;million, it was opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 30 May 1991 as Sheffield Arena.<ref name="about"></ref> The first concert took place that evening, [[Paul Simon]] playing as part of his "Born at the Right Time" tour. The arena then took on the role of Gymnastics Hall for the [[1991 Summer Universiade|1991 World Student Games]] which were held in the city and which prompted the investment in, and development of, both the arena and nearby [[Don Valley Stadium]].

Since the venue opened in 1991 the arena has averaged 122 shows a year with over 650,000 customers passing through the doors each year.<ref name="auto"></ref>

The Arena was the location of the infamous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Sheffield Rally]] during the [[1992 United Kingdom general election]] which was widely criticised for being prematurely triumphalist.<ref name="McDonald">Alyssa McDonald [http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-party-interview-win "The NS Interview: Neil Kinnock"], ''New Statesman'', 29 April 2010</ref>

The arena was renamed [[Hallam FM]] Arena in 2002, but returned to its original name from 1 November 2007.<ref></ref> On 9 August 2010, Sheffield Arena was officially renamed Motorpoint Arena Sheffield, after the [[Derby]] based car sales company invested £1&nbsp;million to rename the venue.<ref></ref> In August 2015 the arena was once again rebranded as Sheffield Arena, however in September 2017 nearby [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]] began sponsoring the arena giving it a rebrand, FlyDSA Arena.<ref></ref> In 2021, [[Utilita Energy]] took over sponsorship of the arena.

The arena underwent a major renovation installing a new roof, doors, seats, lighting, catering and toilet facilities in July 2013.<ref></ref>

In 2013 the arena was ranked as the 18th most popular arena in the world and this was in the year that the building was closed for over 2 months to enable the multi-million pound refurbishment of the venue. More recently, in 2019, [[Pollstar]] ranked the arena at 65th worldwide and 7th in the UK as part of their 'Top 200 Arena Venues'
with 311,125 tickets sold,<ref>https://www.pollstar.com/Chart/2019/12/Top200Arenas_797.pdf </ref> up 5 places from 70th in 2018.<ref>https://www.pollstar.com/Chart/2018/12/2018YearEndWorldwideTicketSalesTop200ArenaVenues_702.pdf </ref>

===COVID-19 pandemic===
During the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom]], the car park is being used as a drive-through [[phlebotomy]] service operated by [[Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], the first of its kind in the country. This allows patients to attend for routine blood tests from within the isolation of their cars, reducing the requirement for patients to attend [[General practitioner|GP]]s or hospital clinics. The drive-through phlebotomy service opened on 8 April 2020 for patients with underlying health conditions,<ref></ref> and was expanded to become available to all patients in the Sheffield area on 27 April.<ref></ref>
