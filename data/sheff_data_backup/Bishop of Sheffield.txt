The '''Bishop of Sheffield''' is the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of Sheffield]] in the [[Province of York]].

A similar title was first created as a suffragan see in the [[Diocese of York]] in 1901. [[John Quirk]], the only [[Bishop suffragan]] of Sheffield assisted the [[Archbishop of York]] in overseeing [[Diocese of York|that diocese]]. Under [[George V]], the Diocese of Sheffield was created out of the south-western part of the Diocese of York in 1914. The bishop's residence is [[Bishopscroft, Ranmoor|Bishopscroft]], [[Ranmoor]]<ref></ref> — west-south-west of the city centre.

On 31 January 2017, it was announced that [[Philip North]] had been nominated to translate to Sheffield before June 2017,<ref name="pn">[http://www.sheffield.anglican.org/news/next-bishop-of-sheffield-announced Diocese of Sheffield — Next Bishop of Sheffield Announced] (Accessed 31 January 2017)</ref> but North withdrew his acceptance of the nomination in March officially citing "personal reasons". Since his nomination, there had been a number of public articles challenging the appropriateness of his appointment, based on his rejection of the ordination of priests who are women and the number of priests in Sheffield diocese who are women.<ref></ref>
